# LuvU

# Project Title: LuvU #

## What is LuvU? Why should I care??? ##
My project will address an often looked over social justice issue of body image. Body image is defined as an individual’s mental image of their own body. People with body image issues can’t see their outer, or more alarmingly inner beauty. This misconception leads them to mistreat themselves and often sets a precedent where anyone can mistreat them. American society and culture is the cause of this issue as the media continues to promote an unattainable ideal of beauty. Although the issue of body image is often associated with teens studies show that eating disorders for children below the age of 12 have risen 119% from 1999 to 2006. Half of girl ages 9-10 say they feel better about themselves when they are dieting. Today America’s children are consuming media through medians like phones like never before. Although these devices are partially to blame for exposing kids to body shaming it can be used benevolently to teach them how to love themselves.

### To throw it all together in a sentence... ###
I want to create an interactive app that allows kids to promote their self-worth through interaction with relatable characters and gameplay.

## How is it going to be made??? ##
 With love, sugar, spice and everything nice of course! I will be implementing this as a computer application at first and adapting it to mobile if time allows using the Godot engine which is open source and you can use to make games in C++.

## Why not just get a Tamagotchi and call it a day??  ## 
Well... there are already body images applications out there, but none address the problem at a young age. Some help people who are already suffering from an eating disorder recover and others target older women with hypnosis or inspirational quotes. My application seeks to do more at a younger age to prevent these kids from becoming insecure teens or adults. I want to build an application that allows kids to make meaningful connection with characters in order to teach them to love themselves and their bodies regardless of what the media dictates is beautiful. Not only will this be a free application it will be the only one to promote self-image in a fun, healthy manner for kids middle school and below.

## Future Innovations ##

The current implenantation is just a starting point for this idea. There are still a lot of things that can be improved upon.

- Better graphics
- Added dialague 
- Scalability for multiple devices
- Improved animation sequences
